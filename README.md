# Dev Blogs

Full-stack MERN application. Users can sign up and create posts linking to useful programming resources. Can be thought of as a public bookmark manager, with liking, comments, and CRUD operations.

### Technologies used:
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Jest
- React
- Redux with redux-thunk
- React Hook Form
- Cypress
- Chakra UI

You can find the site live [here](https://radiant-fortress-53702.herokuapp.com/) (hosted on Heroku so it might take a few extra seconds to wake up and load)
